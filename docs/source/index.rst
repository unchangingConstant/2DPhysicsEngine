Welcome to 2DPhysicsEngine's documentation!
===========================================

**2DPhysicsEngine** is made to be the basis for a video game demo that will come out as a separate project. 
For now, it's capable of handling interactions between an elastic point entity and immovable surfaces. You also have the
capability to control your own point entity using the WASD keys.
